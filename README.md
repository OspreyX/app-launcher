# OpenFin App Launcher

The OpenFin App Launcher is a window where you can easily access multiple apps built on the OpenFin Runtime directly from userâ€™s desktop. The OpenFin App Launcher installs automatically  in the Taskbar (Windows) when installing one of the participating apps in the App Launcher initiative. Here is how it works:   

* Installs automatically with a OpenFin Runtime application download and installation

* OpenFin Launcher located in Windows Taskbar

* Apps launched from launcher prompt users to create a desktop shortcut

* Each application requires a new installer from OpenFin

* Email address required to gain access to apps in Launcher

* Only includes apps participating in the OpenFin Launcher initiative

* Applications provide a 30 day free trial access


## How to run (for now...)

* [create an OpenFin Application](https://github.com/openfin/generator-openfin)
* point the `url` key in the `/public/app.json` to localhost:9000
* create a directory to hold this project 
* `$ git clone` this project into the created directory 
* `$ npm install`
* `$ bower install`
* `$ grunt serve`
* click on OpenFin app desktop shortcut
